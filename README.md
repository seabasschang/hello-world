**Narrator:** My family tells of an ancient legend about two great Dragon brothers; the Dragon of the North Wind and the Dragon of the South Wind. Together, they upheld balance and harmony in the Heavens.

**Narrator:** But the two brothers argued over who could better rule their land. Their quarrel turned to rage and their violent struggle darkened the skies, until the Dragon of the South Wind struck down his brother, and fell to earth, shattering the land.

**Narrator:** The Dragon of the South Wind had triumphed, but as time passed and he realized his solitude. The sweetness of victory turned to ash.

*The Shimada castle of [Hanamura](https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Hanamura) is heavily secured by its guards as [Hanzo](https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Hanzo) appears. He trespasses into the castle, incapacitating the guards, and arriving into the castle's central shrine where [Genji's](https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Genji) sword, Ryūichi moji, is on display. He kneels down, preparing offerings before the sword display, in honor of his supposedly deceased brother.*

**Narrator:** For years the bereft Dragon's grief threw the world into discord and he knew only bitterness and sorrow. One day a stranger called up to the Dragon and asked "Oh, Dragon Lord, why are you so distraught?" The dragon told him "Seeking power I killed my brother, but without him, I am lost." The stranger replied "You have inflicted wounds upon yourself, but now you must heal. Walk the earth on two feet as I do. Find value in humility, then you will find peace."

*Genji has been hiding above the ceiling.*

**Hanzo, aware of Genji's presence, but not of his identity:** You are not the first assassin sent to kill me and you will not be the last.

*Genji, jumping down and making his appearance: You are bold to come to [Shimada castle](https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Hanamura), the den of your enemies.*

**Hanzo:** This was once my home. Did your masters not tell you who I was?!

*Hanzo quickly launches an arrow from his bow towards Genji, who misses it.*

**Genji:** I know who you are, Hanzo. I know you come here every year, on the same day. You risk so much to honor someone you murdered!

*Genji unsheathes his shurikens, launching three of them at Hanzo. Hanzo uses an arrow to block them.*

**Hanzo:** You know nothing of what happened!

*Hanzo launches another arrow at Genji, but he blocks it with his sword. The resulting deflect forces him through a screen, and he falls to lower floor. Genji runs around the room as Hanzo uses scatter arrows against him. Genji swiftly deflects them with his sword, jumping back to the higher floor. He holsters his sword before dashing onto the castle's terrace. Hanzo searches for him there, ready to attack.*

**Genji, standing behind him:** I know you tell yourself that your brother disobeyed [the clan](https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Shimada_Clan) and that you have to kill him to maintain order. That it was your duty.

**Hanzo, throwing another attack as Genji blocks it with his sword:** It was my duty and my burden. That does not mean I do not honor him!

*Hanzo launches one more arrow, that Genji uses his sword to slice in half. An enraged Hanzo swings his bow at Genji, turning the confrontation into a melee fight. Genji overpowers him, pinning him down at the edge of the terrace.*

**Genji:** You think you honor your brother, Genji, with incense offerings? Honor resides in one's actions.

**Hanzo:** You dare to lecture me about honor? You are not worthy to say his name!

*Hanzo regains control, throwing Genji across the terrace before grabbing one of his grounded arrows.*

**Hanzo:** Ryū ga waga teki wo kurau!

**Genji:** Ryūjin no ken wo kurae!

*Hanzo unleashes his [Ultimate Ability](https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Ultimate_ability), but Genji counters it with his own. At the same time, two blue dragons appear and (representing Hanzo) follow a green dragon (representing Genji), moving around him before they fly back towards a shocked Hanzo and disappearing.*

Hanzo, falling to his knees: Only a Shimada can control the Dragons. Who are you?

*Genji zooms aside Hanzo, holding his sword against his neck.*

**Hanzo:** Do it, then. Kill me.

**Genji, moving the katana away from his neck and standing up:** No. I will not grant you the death you wish for. You still have a purpose in this life, brother.

**Hanzo, standing up as well in disbelief:** No... how...? My brother is dead.

*Genji slowly takes off his mask, identifying himself.*

**Hanzo:** Genji!

**Narrator:** The Dragon knelt upon the ground. For the first time he was able to clearly see the world around him and he became human. The stranger revealed himself as his fallen brother. Reunited, the two set out to rebuild what they had once destroyed.

**Hanzo:** What have you become?

**Genji, putting his mask back on:** I have accepted what I am and I have forgiven you. Now you must forgive yourself. The world is changing once again, Hanzo, and it's time to pick a side.

*Genji leaves Hanzo, jumping onto an adjacent rooftop. Hanzo quickly grabs his bow and arrow, aiming it at Genji in rage.*

**Hanzo:** Real life is not like the stories our father told us. You are a fool for believing it so!

**Genji:** Perhaps I am a fool to think that there is still hope for you, but I do. Think on that, brother.

*Hanzo lowers his bow, watching as Genji vanishes in smoke. Going back into the castle, he sits in front of the sword display, holding an arrow in his hand. The camera pans upwards, revealing a painting of the two great Dragon brothers.*
