My family tells of an ancient legend about two great dragon brothers, the dragon of the north wind, and the dragon of the south wind. Together, they have held balance and harmony in the heavens. But the two brother argued over who could better rule their land. Their quarrel turned to rage and their violence struggled darkness skies, until the dragon of the south wind struck down his brother and fell to Earth, shattering the land. The dragon of the south wind triumphed but as time passed and he realized his solitude. The sweetness of victory, turned to ash.
